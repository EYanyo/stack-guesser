    <p>Every software engineer thinks they are smart but can you figure out which Stack Overflow answer is the best from a list of all answers to a question?</p>
    <p>Stack Guesser will present you with a list of 10 recent questions from Stack Overflow that have more than one answer and have an answer marked as accepted.  Your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to identify the correct answer for each question to earn a point.  After choosing an answer for a question, use the Back button to go back to the list and try another one.  See how close you can get to a perfect 10/10 score!</p>
    <p />
    <p>You can also tailor the challenge by entering a semicolon-delimited list of tags in the box below before clicking Start.  For example, "javascript;html".  Find the questions that match your area(s) of expertise!</p>
