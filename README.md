Guess the correct answers from Stack Overflow!

Stack Guesser 1.0

***************************



Stack Guesser is my submission for the AccuLynx Dev Code Challenge of Challenging Coding as part of the hiring process at AccuLynx.  I won't reproduce all the project requirements here, but essentially the goal was to create a web page where visitors are presented with a list of recent Stack Overflow questions and need to guess which answer was the one selected.  I opted to create this page in HTML and Javascript, as I thought JS would be the easiest to integrate with the JSON-formatted Stack Exchange API.  Functionality of the code is documented in in stack-guesser.js and index.html contains the initial splash page for Stack Guesser.



To run, download the directory and open index.html in your favorite web browser.



(wth additional time, I would have added)

Future Improvements and Updates:

*Improved error handling

*More CSS and better overall styling

*Replace the title in the header with a logo image

*Improved scoring taking into account number of up/downvotes on a given answer or even what previous players guessed

	*Overall stats tracking for questions/answers across games to implement the latter part of the above feature or other new functionality

*Additional search criteria/options for questions

*Ability to change the game length from the default 10 questions

*Caching of the questions page rather than redrawing it each time
